## 🧠 Design Philosophy
Why a single HTML file?
This project intentionally uses one self-contained file because:

💻 Small codebase = Faster loading and simpler maintenance
✏️ Edit anywhere - No need to switch between multiple files/folders
🚫 Zero build process - Just edit and refresh!
📦 Portable - Easy to share or deploy anywhere

`"For small projects, complexity should serve the user experience - not the file structure."`
